# youtube-comments
This makes it so much easier to search for specific replies in a 
youtube video. Currently the GUI is not made for it yet. I plan to make
it in the future but for now, the user will need to change the code itself
to search through the comment section using this program. The specific line
that needs to be changed by the user has been commented.

# setup
The user will need to first get an API key from google using a 
google account. More information on how to set it up can be
accessed through google's own website [youtube api key](
https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application). After
inserting the API key, the user can then search for the keywords that they 
are looking for in the comment section of a video and the program will return
all the comments with those keywords.
