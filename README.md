# youtube-replies
This makes it so much easier to search for specific replies in a 
youtube video. Currently the GUI is not made for it yet and I plan to make
it in the future and so the user will need to change the code itself
to search through the comment section using this.

# setup
The user will need to first get an API key from google using a 
google account. More information on how to set it up can be
accessed through google's own website [youtube api key](
https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application). After
inserting the API key, the user can then search for the keywords that they 
are looking for in the comment section of a video and the program will return
all the comments with those keywords.
